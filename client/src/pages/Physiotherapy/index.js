          As you may have already understand, a physiotherapist can get you on
          track to have pain-free movement, which is essential to be able to do
          your favourites physical activities, so preventing a lot of chronic
          diseases, and have some good time too. You can recover well from a
          large variety of conditions with physiotherpists' help. Moreover, even
          if surgery and drugs can be the best course of treatment for certain
          diagnoses, there are conditions in which physiotherapy can be equally
          effective. Take low back pain as an example. There is evidence this
          condition is over-treated with imaging, drugs prescription and
          surgeries, while early physical therapy can be a really cost-effective
          treatment. It is the same if we talk about moderate meniscal tears or
          knee ostheoarthritis, again physiotherapy can be a first choice
          treatment. And what about non-traumatic rotator cuff tear? Guess what?
          There is no differences between surgery and physiotherapy treatment in
          terms of outcomes. So why choose surgery? Anyway, any individual is
          unique, therefore physiotherapists work in team with other healthcare
          professionals, to try to give you always the best treatment you need.
